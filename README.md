ELECTRIC VEHICLE DATA ANALYSIS – PROJECT REPORT

Objective:
The primary aim of this project was to perform exploratory analysis on Electric Vehicle registration data to identify key trends in electric mobility adoption across regions, vehicle makes/models, and fuel types. This analysis helps stakeholders understand the current EV landscape, policy impact, and areas for future improvement.

Tools & Technologies Used:

Tableau for dashboard creation and interactive data visualization

Excel and CSV data transformation

Summary of Dataset:

Total Records: 150,482

Fields: 17 (including Make, Model, EV Type, State, Electric Range, CAFV Eligibility, etc.)

Coverage: Multiple states across the US, primarily focused on WA (Washington)

Key Insights from the Dashboard:

1. EV Adoption Overview:
  - A total of 150,413 vehicles were analyzed, with an average electric range of 67.83 miles.
  - The dataset is dominated by Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs), making up 77.62% of the total, while Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs) account for 22.38%.

2. State-Level Distribution:
  - Washington State (especially King County) has the highest EV adoption, contributing nearly the entire dataset’s vehicle count.
  - Urban centers such as Seattle, Bellevue, and Tacoma lead in EV usage.

3. Model Year Trend:
  - Significant growth is observed post-2015, with a peak in 2023 at 37.1K vehicle registrations.
  - EV registrations saw exponential growth from 2017 to 2023, suggesting increased market penetration and consumer interest.

4. Top Makes & Models:
  - Tesla is the most popular make, representing 57.49% of vehicles in the dataset.
  - Model Y, Model 3, and Leaf dominate the vehicle models.
  - Other notable brands include Nissan, Chevrolet, Ford, and BMW.

5. CAFV Eligibility Analysis:
  - 41.81% of vehicles are CAFV Eligible (Clean Alternative Fuel Vehicle), while 46.34% have unknown eligibility—indicating potential data gaps or policy communication issues.

6. EV Type Preferences:
  - BEVs are far more common than PHEVs, indicating user preference for fully electric mobility and possibly the availability of supporting infrastructure.

Strategic Recommendations & Future Steps:

Data Enhancement & Cleansing:
  - Address the high volume of "CAFV Unknown" values by standardizing eligibility classification and integrating external data sources or updated policy tags.

Public Infrastructure Expansion:
  - Focus on expanding EV charging stations in counties with low adoption. Promote accessibility through government-private partnerships.

State-Wise Policy Insights:
  - Analyze state incentive programs contributing to high EV adoption in Washington and replicate those policies in low-adoption states.

Promote Hybrid Adoption in Low-Range Areas:
  - In areas where electric range may be limiting due to terrain or distance, promote PHEVs with incentives and awareness campaigns.

Manufacturer Collaboration:
  - Use insights to collaborate with high-performing OEMs (e.g., Tesla, Nissan, Chevrolet) for future partnerships or incentive-based offers.

Educate Consumers:
  - Launch awareness programs focused on the benefits of BEVs over PHEVs, especially in regions where BEVs are underrepresented.

Outcome:
The dashboard provides a clear and interactive view of the EV landscape, enabling policy makers, manufacturers, and researchers to make informed decisions. This project serves as a foundation for scalable sustainability analysis and can be extended to include battery degradation, cost of ownership, and lifecycle emissions.
